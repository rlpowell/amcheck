Check the timings (using debug) on BodyCheckRegex with the real data

Build a check for warnings/errors/etc using BodyAnyCheck; see how it
goes.

Set any mails that fail a check / cause an alert to Flagged and push
them back to the inbox.  Alter the rest of the code to ignore
Flagged messages (just add UNFLAGGED to search probably).

Put the `amcheck_storage` name into the settings.  And maybe INBOX
too.

Add to README:
- the notes from configuration.rs
- Special case: empty matcher matches all mails in the check phase, but is ignored in the move phase.
- BodyCheckAny and BodyCheckAll only work on literal strings
- BodyCheckRegex is very slow
- note that it would be possible to do body searches in the filters
  if anyone actually has a use case for that
