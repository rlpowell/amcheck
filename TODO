Make tests
----------

X make a test using our own actual email and the current binary as a
  regression test suite
X make sure the directory with the source for those is in .gitignore
- split out the check config into a config file
- move the check config optionally be drawn from a separate config
  file (pointed at by the main config?), so each test can have one
- make a new, minimal test with just a few sanitized emails and a
  simple check config; that can get checked in
- update the local / personal-email regression test to use the full
  config, make sure it still works

- ---------

X Add tracing.

Drop most of the ".unwrap()"s (i.e. convert stuff to Result)

Clean all the FIXMEs

Start working on the automatic checker.

X clippy

error handling: thiserrer + anyhow or eyre or miette?; ask djan/tene; also maybe spandoc?
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpVzSse7oJ4 covers why you want
  thiserror well; good overview of Rust error handling
