Skip a checker that has an empty checker_tree; time the difference

Set any mails that fail a check / cause an alert to Flagged and push
them back to the inbox.  Alter the rest of the code to ignore
Flagged messages (just add UNFLAGGED to search probably).

Put the `amcheck_storage` name into the settings.  And maybe INBOX
too.

Add to README:
- the notes from configuration.rs
- Special case: empty matcher matches all mails in the check phase, but is ignored in the move phase.
- Body checks only work on literal strings
- make it clear that you'll need to massage your scripts to what it
  is possible for amcheck to do, because complex body text searches
  are extremely slow
